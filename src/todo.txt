Idee:
	abstract ZeroMq and have type safe protocol for inproc and tcp
	use a single Instance and configure in a simple way, without the need to understand all intricate details of ZeroMQ

core
	later:
		async / Router dealer socket
		Discovery

Backlog:
features
    Pub / Sub / Publisher / Sub and Bus? --> async subscribers

    extend XtResult with callbacks 
    socket as a bus ? (single instance to access all handler types)
    Demistify for stacktrace
    Performance (Utf8)

    Tests:
        Complex Types
        inheritance for types?


misc
    load test with 10 K Messages / s


extra projects for each serializer package
    a la
    heitech.zeroMqXt.Serializing.Utf8json
    heitech.zeroMqXt.Serializing.Newtonsoftjson


integrate netmq users 
    derive socket from their netmqsocket with extension methods

Operation as Enum
Context for every Call
    Operation
    In / Out processing
    MessageType
    FrameCount


Todo Failure scenarios
    check what happens if more than one server is setup with the same type for Rq/Rep
    async Response?
